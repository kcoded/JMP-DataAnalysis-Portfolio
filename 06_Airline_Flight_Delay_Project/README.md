# ✈️ Airline Flight Delay Analysis

## Summary for General Audiences

Thursday and Friday flights in June carry the highest 
risk of delay. Delta and Southwest consistently 
outperform other major carriers regardless of month 
or day. If you fly American, Northwest, United, or 
US Airways avoid end-of-week summer departures.

## Research Question

When are you likely to experience the longest flight 
delays?

## Background

- Data covers all major US airlines
- Variables include: Month, Day of Week, Arrival Delay, 
Distance, and Airline
- Arrival Delay measured in minutes (negative = arrived 
early)
- Analysis performed in JMP 17 Pro

## Answer

Delays are longest on **Thursdays and Fridays**, 
especially in **June and July**. **Delta and Southwest** 
have significantly lower average delays than American, 
Northwest, United, and US Airways.

## Key Findings

| Factor | Worst | Best |
|---|---|---|
| Airline | American, Northwest | Delta, Southwest |
| Month | June, July, December | February, March |
| Day of Week | Thursday, Friday | Tuesday, Wednesday |

## Visualization Strategy

| Chart | Purpose | Insight |
|---|---|---|
| Dot plots by Airline | Compare delay distributions across carriers | American has highest mean (14.2 min) and variability |
| Trellis: Month × Airline | Seasonal patterns per carrier | Jun/Jul elevated across most airlines |
| Heat Map: Month × Day of Week | Identify worst time combinations per airline | Thu/Fri in June is highest-risk combination |

The heat map is the most powerful chart for answering 
"when?" it captures two time-based variables 
simultaneously and makes the worst combinations 
immediately visible.

## Conclusion

The heat map of Month vs Day of Week colored by mean 
arrival delay reveals that **Thursday and Friday in June** 
is the highest-risk combination for delays. Delta and 
Southwest are clear outliers their heat maps show 
almost no red regardless of timing, confirming their 
lower average delays across all months and days.

If you must fly a higher-risk carrier (American, 
Northwest, United, or US Airways):

- **Avoid:** Thursday and Friday departures
- **Avoid:** June, July, and December travel
- **Prefer:** Tuesday or Wednesday departures
- **Prefer:** February, March, or April travel
